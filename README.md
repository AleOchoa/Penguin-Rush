# PENGUIN RUSH

## Introduction
A multiplayer game having two penguins racing to be the first to arrive to the fish. Based on **Penguin Pursuit** by [Lumosity](https://www.lumosity.com/).

You have to go through a maze which is rotating randomly 90°,180° or 270°. The commands are exactly the same and only the view is changing. It's a game to test your sense of direction.
